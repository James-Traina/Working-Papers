This repo is for my working papers that are revised too often for [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2227781).

## "[Labor Market Power and Technological Change in US Manufacturing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/James-Traina/Working-Papers/main/Markups-Markdowns.pdf)," with [Ivan Kirov](https://sites.google.com/view/ivankirov/)
We estimate time-varying plant-level production functions with Census microdata to identify separately product and labor market power in the US manufacturing sector. Wage markdowns rose substantially from 1 in 1972 to 2 in 2014, while price markups stayed flat at 1. Wage markdowns rose because marginal-revenue-product growth speeds up, not because wage growth stagnates. In local labor markets, wage-markdown growth is uncorrelated with employer-concentration growth. We document strong associations with direct measures of information and communication technologies and indirect measures of management and automation technologies. Altogether, the evidence points to technological threat as a key driver of labor market power.

## "[Profit Puzzles and the Fall of Public-Firm Profit Rates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/James-Traina/Working-Papers/main/Profit-Puzzles.pdf)," with [Carter Davis](https://sites.google.com/site/carterkentdavis/) and [Alex Sollaci](https://sites.google.com/view/alexandresollaci/)
Why are aggregate profit rates and factor shares divorced from financial-market measures of the cost of capital? We propose a novel explanation: National accounts track all firms, while financial markets track public firms only. In contrast to stable aggregate profits rates, we show public-firm profit rates have fallen since 1980, matching financial markets and suggesting low market power. The public-firm share of capital is stable; implied private-firm profit rates have risen. Size and sector differences cannot explain the divergence, though R\&D intensity or capital wedges might. Our results indicate substantial biases in extrapolating public-firm trends to the aggregate economy.

## "[Seven Million Demand Elasticities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/James-Traina/Working-Papers/main/Demand-Elasticities.pdf)," with [Jordan Rosenthal-Kay](https://jrosenthalkay.github.io/) and [Uyen Tran](http://uyenbtran.com/)
The household’s price elasticity of demand is a key input to many economic models’ construction of markups and the assessment of consumer surplus. We measure the price elasticity of demand for around 14,000 products by region-year using retail scanner data. In all, we estimate over 7.5 million demand elasticities. We find that the distribution of these elasticities is stationary over time. However, we document substantial spatial heterogeneity in consumers’ price sensitivity: consumers in the largest markets are the most price elastic. As demand elasticities are a key input into the measurement of markups, our results suggest that any conclusions that markups are rising in retail markets must be driven by assumptions on conduct.
